== Overview ==

The Accelerator is a 16 (maximum) week program. The first week is a crash course in Accelerator mindsets and tools. The last week is focused on preparing to communicate and present the project and learnings. In between are up to 14 weeks tailored to the project. We recommend breaking up the time efficiently to maximize product validation.

To this end, we have packaged up typical types of learning, building and validating tasks into 1 or more week "sprints". These sprints can be added and re-configured as necessary. Coaches can recommend a sprint based on the needs of a team. Coaches can also unbundle a few activities from the sprint as needed.

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a major milestone that dramatically changes what a team does. Before the MVP, the team does a series of "spikes" or validates parts of the business model in isolation. Upon working on the MVP, engineering practices become important. Once an MVP is launched the team is running a business and must support operations in addition to validating and optimizing the business model.

== Module: Inspiration ==

Duration:: 1-2 weeks
Input:: Design challenge, or business opportunity statement, sometimes in the form of How Might We...
Output:: Point of View about the customer
 
=== General Approach ===
This sprint requires some preparation ahead of time. Lining up customers and activities requires lead time. To make the best use of a week, the accelerator needs to take the team from one activity to the next, similar to what a tour bus does for tourists.
 
=== Activities ===
The following are possible activities to be done according to need:

* Review existing customer insights such as trend reports, articles, etc.
* Observation of people in their context. May include analogous situations and extreme users.
* One to two-hour, in-depth interviews in a natural setting. (Expect to cost about $350/person including recruiting and compensation. Up to 16 people to build deep empathy.)
* Synthesis
* Affinity Map
* KJ analysis (question)
* Space saturation
* Value opportunity analysis
* Journey map
* JTBD Timeline, Forces, Min/Max
* customer-job matrix footnote:[What Customers Want, Anthony Ulwick, 2005]
** existing customer / current job (incremental/breakthrough innovation)
** existing customer / new job (incremental/breakthrough innovation)
** new customer / current job (low-end disruption, new market innovation)
** new customer / new job (quite rare; not actually a new job but a radical departure from how things worked previously, e.g. phonograph, telephone)

=== Example High Level Schedule ===
* Day 1: Research
* Day 2: Observation
* Day 3: Interviews
* Day 4: Share
* Day 5: Synthesis - Aha! 

== Module: Ideation ==

Duration:: 1 week
Inputs::
  * Point of View (customer problem) statement
  * Your past experiences and understanding of customers
Outputs::
  * Concept is sufficiently defined (understood) from an end-user point of view to build a Minimum Viable Product
  * Business Model Canvas as a record of what is about to be built (to be continuously updated going forward)
  * Pitch deck outline highlighting important points to present and current best guess of results and confidence (to be continuously updated going forward)
 
=== Levels of Resolution ===

This sprint is iterative, but the activities performed change with the level of resolution required. The following are the different levels of resolution a team would go through:

* POV -> Idea groups
** Start with only a POV statement
** Ideate many ideas
** Cluster ideas into a manageable number of groups
* Idea groups -> Single idea and value proposition
** Start with a single idea group
** Ideate ideas within the group, if necessary
** Select an idea to define
* Specific idea -> Defined concept
** Start with a specific idea
** Ideate several implementations, usually from an end user perspective
** Select one of the variants to go build
* Feature design
** Light weight design used when implementing specific features for an MVP
 
=== Activities ===

The following is the high level process that is applied regardless of the level of resolution.

[horizontal]
*Diverge*:: if more options are necessary
*Converge*:: using the following approach
*Prototype*:: to gain experience
*Select*:: using results from prototyping

Continue converging, or diverge if more options are needed until landing on a single option
 
The following are examples of activities that could be done. The team must select the appropriate activity based on the level of resolution interesting to the team.

Diverge::
  * Brainstorming
  * Standup, all-at-once
  * 1-2-4-All 
  * Systematic Inventive Thinking (question) 
Converge (General)::
  * Affinity Map
  * Jobs To Be Done Min-Max Codification 
Prototype::
  * Bodystorm
  * Mock-ups
  * Storyboard
  * Screenflow
  * Business Model Canvas & Pitch Deck
  * Lead generation website
Select::
  * Dot voting
  * Performance metrics 

[TIP]
=======
Look for "Yes, exactly!" responses. Pivot away if getting lukewarm responses, but do verify they understand your idea first.

== Planning ==

=== Reducing Risk ===

The innovation process is iterative and flexible. However, setting aside four month for an innovation engagement is a good rule of thumb. This would allow for an Inspiration sprint, an Ideation sprint, a spike or two, an MVP, a pivot or two back into Ideation, a few Iterations and a Pitch.

If you are operating in a space you are already familiar with (e.g. you are your customer), your MVP is simple, and you land on a successful business model the first time, you may need significantly less time. Conversely, in unfamiliar domains with excessive risk and complex solutions, this process may take significantly more time.

We have created this modular approach to innovation to allow for the flexible planning of innovation engagements. The idea is to identify the next greatest risk and to select the appropriate module to reduce that risk.

If you are in a time-bounded context such as a startup accelerator or a business plan competition, you will fill up your extra time with as many Iterate sprints as possible. If you have no time limit, but you are not yet profitable, you will fit in as many Iterate sprints as your burn-down chart/runway allows.

=== Done ===

A definition of innovation we particularly like is: "Aggregate change in behavior." In other words, innovation is not just invention, creativity, validated learning, a business model, or a great pitch; instead, we look for the impact of a concept on the world. This impact may be giant value for a few people, or a tiny value for a large population; it is the total impact that defines the degree of innovation.

So, one might ask, "When is an innovation engagement done?". This has three answers:

* You are done if you validated your concept is not desireable, viable, feasible, repeatable, scalable or profitable.
* You are done when your concept is acquired.
* You are done when your concept has become a business.

= Innovation Anti-Patterns =

* Design-only, Hand-off recommendations
* Approval by Value-chain-dependent executives
* optimize organization (enemy of new concepts)
* First we need to X, then we'll be ready to innovate
